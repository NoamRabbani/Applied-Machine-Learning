To run test with the implemented naive bayes classifier(since the trianing and validation are splitted randomly at each execution, the results are sligtly different each time):

python3 bernoulli_naive_bayes_tests.py

To run test with the best model(gives the accuracy on training, validation sets and the cross validation score, as well as the top positive and negative words):

python3 best_model.py
